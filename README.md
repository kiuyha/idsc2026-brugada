# Brugada Syndrome Detection via Graph Neural Networks and Deep Learning

This repository contains the full experimental pipeline for the [IDSC 2026](https://idsc2026.github.io) submission: a comparative study of Histogram Gradient Boosting, ResNet, and Spatial Graph Neural Network architectures for automated binary classification of Brugada syndrome from 12-lead ECG signals using the Brugada-HUCA dataset from [PhysioNet](https://physionet.org/content/brugada-huca/1.0.0).

The codebase is structured to support reproducible hyperparameter search, model comparison across multiple random seeds, and interpretability analysis via lead importance scores derived from the GNN embeddings.


## Results

The following table reports mean and standard deviation across 5 independent seeds (42 through 46) on the held-out test set. All models use their best hyperparameter configurations from random search. Results are sorted by F2 score, which is the primary evaluation metric.

F2 score weights recall twice as heavily as precision, reflecting the clinical cost asymmetry in Brugada syndrome screening: a missed positive case (false negative) carries a risk of sudden cardiac death, while a false positive results in an unnecessary but non-harmful cardiology referral. Accuracy is included for completeness but is not a meaningful metric given the class imbalance. It is also worth noting that a trivial classifier predicting all negatives would achieve approximately 79% accuracy.

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | AUC | F2 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Spatial GNN | 0.7418 ± 0.0694 | 0.4654 ± 0.0816 | **0.8333 ± 0.1394** | 0.5883 ± 0.0719 | **0.8519 ± 0.0631** | **0.7099 ± 0.0899** |
| ResNet | 0.8036 ± 0.0624 | 0.5600 ± 0.1255 | 0.7333 ± 0.1333 | **0.6235 ± 0.0967** | 0.8384 ± 0.0487 | 0.6814 ± 0.1058 |
| HGB | **0.8036 ± 0.0602** | **0.5655 ± 0.1176** | 0.5868 ± 0.2851 | 0.5382 ± 0.1747 | 0.8192 ± 0.1179 | 0.5586 ± 0.2343 |

The Spatial GNN leads on F2 (0.7099 vs 0.6814) and AUC (0.8519 vs 0.8384), with the gap now statistically meaningful after correcting an error in the anatomical adjacency construction. The original implementation at commit [9e5364](https://github.com/kiuyha/idsc2026-brugada/commit/9e5364750365a919ba94b815e96acdfdd187763f) included three unjustified connections between augmented limb leads (aVR-aVL, aVR-aVF, aVL-aVF) that have no shared physical electrode and therefore no clinical basis in Einthoven's triangle. Removing these and adding the missing clinically justified connections produced a 0.0235 F2 improvement and reduced standard deviation from 0.1231 to 0.0899, indicating more stable generalization across data splits.

The Spatial GNN achieves higher recall (0.833 vs 0.733) at the cost of lower precision (0.465 vs 0.560), making it the preferred model for screening where missing a positive case is the more critical failure mode. ResNet remains more stable on accuracy and precision. HGB underperforms both deep learning models on F2 with the highest variance in recall (std 0.285), indicating unreliable sensitivity across splits. Both deep learning models clearly outperform the traditional ML baseline.


## Dataset

The project uses the Brugada-HUCA dataset (PhysioNet), which contains 12-lead ECG recordings from 363 patients: 76 diagnosed with Brugada syndrome and 287 normal controls. Signals are sampled at 100 Hz over 10-second windows, yielding 1000 samples per lead per patient.

The dataset must be downloaded from PhysioNet and placed at the path specified in `configs/base.yml` under `data.path`. The expected directory structure is:

```
<data_path>/
    metadata.csv
    files/
        <patient_id>/
            <patient_id>.hea
            <patient_id>.dat
```

The `metadata.csv` file must contain at minimum a `patient_id` column and a `brugada` column with binary labels. Optional columns `basal_pattern` and `sudden_death` are used as auxiliary task labels when enabled in the config.

## Installation

The project uses `uv` for dependency management. To install:

```bash
uv sync
```

Alternatively with pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Python 3.10 or later is required. The `.python-version` file specifies the exact version used during development.


## Configuration System

All experiments are controlled through YAML configuration files. Model-specific configs inherit from `configs/base.yml` using the `_base_` key, which triggers deep merging at load time — only fields explicitly set in the child config override the base.

The base config defines data paths, training hyperparameters, task definitions, loss function parameters, and evaluation settings. Any field can be overridden at runtime using the `--override` flag in `main.py` without modifying config files.

The key fields in `configs/base.yml`:

- `data.path`: path to the PhysioNet dataset directory
- `data.correlation_threshold`: edge pruning threshold for the hybrid adjacency matrix (spatial GNN only)
- `data.anatomic_weight`: weight given to the fixed anatomical adjacency versus the data-driven correlation adjacency (spatial GNN only)
- `training.loss_function`: either `focal` or `bce`; focal loss is used with `alpha=0.79` derived from the class distribution (287/363)
- `tasks`: each task has an `enabled` flag and a `weight` controlling its contribution to the multi-task loss
- `evaluation.primary_metric`: the metric used for early stopping and checkpoint saving; set to `f2` throughout


## Models

### Histogram Gradient Boosting (HGB)

The HGB baseline uses scikit-learn's `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` wrapped in `MultiOutputClassifier` for multi-task support. Because it is a traditional ML model, each output is an independent classifier with no shared representation. Feature extraction is performed by `extract_features()` in `hgb_baseline.py`, which computes handcrafted ECG morphology features per lead: signal statistics (mean, std, max, min), ST-segment elevation, J-point amplitude, ST slope, R-prime wave amplitude, QRS duration proxy, and T-wave polarity. These features are clinically motivated by the known ECG markers of Brugada syndrome.

Training uses the `TraditionalTrainer` class, which extracts features from all batches, fits the model in one call, and evaluates using the same metric pipeline as the deep learning models.

### 1D ResNet

The ResNet processes all 12 leads simultaneously as a multi-channel 1D signal. The architecture is a stack of `ResNetBlock` modules, each containing two Conv1d layers with BatchNorm and SiLU activation and a skip connection. The first block accepts 12 input channels (one per lead). Subsequent blocks optionally downsample with stride 2, controlled by the `resnet_channels` hyperparameter list. Global average pooling collapses the temporal dimension before the task-specific linear heads.

BatchNorm is effective here because it normalizes over the temporal dimension (1000 samples), providing stable batch statistics even with small batch sizes.

### Spatial GNN

The SpatialGNN uses a per-lead ResNet encoder to extract temporal embeddings, then applies graph convolution over a lead-level graph where nodes are leads and edges represent inter-lead spatial relationships.

#### Graph Construction

The lead graph is constructed per patient as a weighted combination of two adjacency matrices: a fixed anatomical adjacency and a data-driven correlation adjacency. This hybrid formulation incorporates domain knowledge about electrode placement alongside learned signal correlations to produce clinically grounded graph structures.

The anatomical adjacency encodes the known physical and electrical relationships between the 12 standard leads. The lead ordering used throughout is I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF (indices 0-5, limb leads) and V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6 (indices 6-11, precordial leads). Connections are defined by two clinical principles.

For the limb leads, edges follow Einthoven's triangle (Goldberger et al., 2013, p. 19), which describes the three standard bipolar leads (I, II, III) as forming a triangle of potential differences around the heart, with aVR, aVL, and aVF derived as augmented unipolar leads from the same electrode set. The specific connections implemented are I-II, I-aVL, II-III, II-aVF, III-aVF, aVR-aVL, aVR-aVF, and aVL-aVF.

For the precordial leads, edges connect sequentially adjacent electrodes (V1-V2, V2-V3, V3-V4, V4-V5, V5-V6), reflecting their physical placement across the chest wall. Goldberger et al. (2013, p. 22) describes V1 through V6 as electrodes placed at six designated positions progressing across the chest wall, with each electrode recording the electrical field at its immediate anatomical location — justifying the sequential edge structure.

The correlation adjacency is computed per patient from the Pearson correlation matrix of the 12 lead signals, capturing dynamic inter-lead relationships that vary with individual cardiac anatomy and pathology. These two matrices are combined as:

```python
hybrid_adj = anatomic_weight * anatomical_adj + (1 - anatomic_weight) * correlation_adj
```

Edges are retained only where the hybrid weight exceeds `correlation_threshold`, pruning weak or noisy connections. Both `anatomic_weight` and `correlation_threshold` are treated as hyperparameters and tuned during search. The resulting edge index and edge weights are batched across patients in the dataloader using node index offsets of 12 per sample.

This construction is particularly motivated by the localized nature of Brugada syndrome. The defining ECG pattern — coved-type ST elevation with negative T-wave — is almost exclusively expressed in the right precordial leads V1 and V2. By anchoring the graph structure to known anatomical connectivity, the GNN is guided to attend to the clinically relevant neighbourhood around V1 and V2 rather than discovering it purely from data on a dataset of only 363 patients.

Note that limb leads (indices 0-5) and precordial leads (indices 6-11) have no direct edges in the anatomical adjacency matrix. Cross-group connections can only arise through the correlation component when two leads from different groups exhibit strong Pearson correlation above the threshold. This design choice reflects the anatomical reality that limb leads and precordial leads record fundamentally different projections of the cardiac electrical vector.

#### GNN Architecture

The GNN supports GCN, GAT, and GIN layer types. GCN and GAT use `add_self_loops=True` and accept edge weights. GIN requires an explicit MLP per layer and does not use edge weights since its expressiveness is encoded in the epsilon-based self-feature weighting. BatchNorm is not applied after GNN layers because the effective batch over which normalization occurs is only 12 nodes per sample (the number of leads), which is insufficient for stable batch statistics.

Lead importance scores are computed in `get_lead_importance()` as the L2 norm of each node's final GNN embedding, normalized across leads. Higher norm indicates greater contribution to the classification decision.


## Training

### Single Run

To train a model with a specific config:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/resnet_baseline.yml
```

To override specific config values without editing the YAML:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/spatial_gnn.yml --override training.learning_rate=0.001 data.batch_size=32
```

To set a specific seed:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/resnet_baseline.yml --seed 43
```

To set a specific device:

```bash
python main.py --config configs/resnet_baseline.yml --device cuda:0
```

The training loop uses AdamW with cosine annealing LR schedule and optional linear warmup. Early stopping monitors the primary task F2 score on the validation set. The best checkpoint is saved to `experiments/best_model.pt` and automatically loaded for test evaluation at the end of each run. Test results are written to `experiments/<experiment_name>.csv`.

### Class Imbalance Handling

The dataset has approximately a 1:3.8 positive-to-negative ratio. Two mechanisms address this simultaneously. First, `WeightedRandomSampler` oversamples the minority class during training so each batch contains a more balanced class distribution. Second, focal loss with `alpha=0.79` (computed from the class frequency) and `gamma=2.0` downweights easy negatives and focuses gradient updates on hard examples and the minority class.


## Hyperparameter Search

Hyperparameter search is run per model using random sampling over a predefined search space. Each trial runs the model with three fixed seeds (42, 43, 44) and reports the mean and standard deviation of the primary metric across seeds.

```bash
python -m src.scripts.hyperparameter_search --model resnet_baseline --search random --n_random 20
```

```bash
python -m src.scripts.hyperparameter_search --model spatial_gnn --search random --n_random 20
```

```bash
python -m src.scripts.hyperparameter_search --model hgb_baseline --search random --n_random 20
```

Available arguments:

- `--model`: one of `hgb_baseline`, `resnet_baseline`, `spatial_gnn`
- `--search`: `random` (default) or `grid`; grid search is only practical for HGB given its smaller search space
- `--n_random`: number of random trials (default 20)
- `--max_trials`: cap the number of trials regardless of search type

Each trial creates a temporary config variant in `configs/variants/`, runs `main.py` as a subprocess, reads the output CSV from `experiments/`, and aggregates results. After all trials complete, the best configuration is saved to `configs/best/<model_type>.yml` and the full results table is saved to `experiments/hyperparam_search_<model>_<search>.csv`.

The search spaces are defined in `SEARCH_SPACES` at the top of `hyperparameter_search.py` and can be modified directly. The spatial GNN search space includes `correlation_threshold` and `anatomic_weight` as data-level parameters alongside the standard model hyperparameters, since graph construction is integral to model behavior.


## Model Comparison

After hyperparameter search is complete for all models, the final comparison evaluates each best config across five seeds (42 through 46):

```bash
python -m src.scripts.compare_models
```

This script reads from `configs/best/` for each model, runs training and evaluation per seed, aggregates mean and standard deviation of all metrics across seeds, and writes the final comparison table to `experiments/model_comparison.csv`.

The five-seed evaluation is intentionally broader than the three-seed search to reduce variance in the final reported numbers. This approach is a form of Monte Carlo cross-validation where each seed independently shuffles the train/validation split and re-initializes model weights, testing robustness to both data partitioning and initialization variance simultaneously.


## Interpretability

The `notebook.ipynb` serves as the primary interpretability workspace. It loads a trained SpatialGNN checkpoint and computes lead importance scores for individual patients and across the test set. Expected outputs include per-patient bar charts of lead importance and aggregate heatmaps showing which leads the model consistently weights highest for Brugada-positive versus Brugada-negative patients.

For a correctly functioning model on Brugada syndrome, V1 and V2 (indices 6 and 7 in the lead ordering) should rank highest in importance for positive cases, consistent with clinical knowledge that the coved-type ST elevation in right precordial leads is the defining electrocardiographic marker of Brugada syndrome.

The `src/interpretability.py` module contains utility functions used by the notebook for loading checkpoints, running inference, and computing importance scores. It is not invoked during training or evaluation and is intended solely for post-hoc analysis.


## Reproducibility

All randomness in the pipeline is controlled through a single seed value in the config, which is passed to Python's `random`, NumPy, and PyTorch (including CUDA) via `set_seed()` in `utils.py`. CUDA determinism is enforced via `torch.backends.cudnn.deterministic = True`.

The train/validation/test split is performed using stratified sampling with the config seed as the `random_state`, ensuring the same seed always produces the same split. This means that changing only the seed in the comparison script genuinely varies both the data partition and the weight initialization independently.

To exactly reproduce the reported results, run `compare_models.py` using the configs in `configs/best/` without modification. The hyperparameter search results in `experiments/` document the full search history for each model.
